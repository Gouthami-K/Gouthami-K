# Hi there, I'm GOUTHAMI K 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in key skills required for this exciting field. In this README, I'll introduce myself and share the languages and skills I've been developing.

## About Me

- 🎓 I recently graduated with a Masters Degree from [CHRIST UNIVERSITY].
- 📚 I have a strong academic background in mathematics and statistics, which I believe is essential for data science.
- 💡 I'm highly motivated to solve real-world problems using data-driven insights.
- 👩‍💻 I'm eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to data science projects.

## Skills

I'm proficient in the following key skills required for data science:

1. **Python**: Python is my primary programming language, and I use it for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. I'm comfortable with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

2. **SQL**: I can write SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from relational databases, a crucial skill for working with real-world datasets.

3. **Data Analysis**: I can clean, preprocess, and analyze data to derive meaningful insights. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is one of my strengths.

4. **Machine Learning**: I have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and have implemented various algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

5. **Data Visualization**: I can create informative and visually appealing data visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and ggplot2.

6. **Version Control**: I'm familiar with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration on coding projects.
